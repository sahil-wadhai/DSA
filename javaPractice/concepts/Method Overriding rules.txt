1)
Overriding and Access Modifiers
The access modifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method. 
For example, a protected instance method in the superclass can be made public, but not private, in the subclass. 
Doing so will generate a compile-time error. 

2)
Final methods can not be overridden

3)
Static methods can not be overridden(Method Overriding vs Method Hiding): 

4)
Private methods can not be overridden
Private methods cannot be overridden as they are bonded during compile time. 
Therefore we canâ€™t even override private methods in a subclass.

5)
The overriding method must have the same return type (or subtype)
class SuperClass {
	public Object method()
	{
		System.out.println(
			"This is the method in SuperClass");
		return new Object();
	}
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
	public String method()
	{
		System.out.println(
			"This is the method in SubClass");
		return "Hello, World!";
	}
}

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		SuperClass obj1 = new SuperClass();
		obj1.method();

		SubClass obj2 = new SubClass();
		obj2.method();
	}
}

6)
Invoking overridden method from sub-class
We can call the parent class method in the overriding method using the super keyword. 

class Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Parent's show()"); }
}
 
// Inherited class
class Child extends Parent {
    // This method overrides show() of Parent
    @Override void show()
    {
        super.show();
        System.out.println("Child's show()");
    }
}

-> overriding and exception handling
1)
If the super-class overridden method does not throw an exception, 
the subclass overriding method can only throw the unchecked exception, 
throwing a checked exception will lead to a compile-time error. 

2)
If the superclass overridden method does throw an exception, 
the subclass overriding method can only throw the same, subclass exception. 
Also, there is no issue if the subclass overridden method is not throwing any exception.
