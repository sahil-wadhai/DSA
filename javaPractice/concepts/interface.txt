-> To declare an interface, use the interface keyword.
-> All the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and 
are public and abstract by default
-> All variables are public, static, and final by default.
example:

interface Player
{
    int id = 10;
    int move();
}

class CricketPlayer implements Player{

    @Override
    int move(){
        System.out.println("moving like cricket player");
        return 1;
    }
}

->
Uses of Interfaces in Java are mentioned below:

1) It is used to achieve total abstraction.
2) Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, 
by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
3) Any class can extend only one class, but can implement multiple interfaces.
4) It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
5) Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.
